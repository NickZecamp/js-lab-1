# Reflection
### Nik Norman - Lab 1

In this lab I focused on web development and developed my skills in HTML and CSS. I created a website where I offered various categories like an academic description and my contact information. I learned important methods for formatting content efficiently and using CSS to maintain its presentation across multiple devices.

I discovered that semantic HTML greatly enhances content organization. The content had to be arranged thoughtfully for users and search engines while emphasis was placed on website appearance. I adopted tags like <header>, <main>, and <footer> to form a clear layout; I understood how much this enhances navigation with anchor links.

Creating a design for the website with the help of CSS presented obstacles and results that were extremely gratifying. I gained insight into how flexbox aligns elements such as the navigation bar for a responsive design. I found that hovering and interactive design elements transform a website into a lively space with changing link colors.

Implementing responsiveness was one of the toughest aspects of the project. Scaling all elements appropriately required numerous changes using media queries. I examined the layout for different screen sizes and fine-tuned image dimensions and the display of the navigation bar on mobile devices.

I focused on making the form for users to contact. Initially the arrangement of labels and input fields for the form seemed uncomplicated; yet achieving a design suitable for the site and maintaining usability demanded more effort. I understood the issues surrounding using "mailto" for sending form information and began to recognize the demand for sophisticated backend tools in future initiatives.

Trying to organize color options became an unexpected challenge. I discovered that although the colors were calming and attractive they often complicated the readability of my text. I needed to find a way to keep the soft aesthetic while making everything clear and readable. Some trial and error with various shades and differences in contrast allowed me to perfect it. At the conclusion of my time in the lab it turned out to be an excellent educational experience.
